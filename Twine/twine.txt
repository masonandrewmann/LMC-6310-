Intro to Twine 2

Twine 2 is available to use online and for download at https://twinery.org/
Usine Twine online only saves your Twine games in the browser history of the engine you use to start the game. It is recommended that you download Twine instead. 

Basics: 
* Twine games are published in HTML/CSS/JS

* Stories are organized using "passages". Once a passage is created, you can add a title and source content/code for the passage. 

* Words within passages can be linked to other passages in order to create interactive narratives. Place words in two [[square brackets]] to create links. 

* use a pipe followed by text to title the new passage: [[link | passage name]]  

* Export your games using 'Publish to File' in the Twine editor 

Story Formats:
* Story formats provide basic defaults for how stories are coded in Twine. Harlowe is the default (and simplest) story format for Twine games 
* Sugarcube 2 is a story format bundled with Twine. It makes changing the appearance of your story more flexible
